## Explanation
Relevant files have been copied over from Scrape_pubs project.  

The script readHindawi.Rmd is set up to scrape data from Hindawi journal website.
As well as DOI, title, authors, email, etc we have dates of receipt, revision, acceptance and publication, editor, and title of special issue (if any). 

The list of journals was originally based on Smut_journals.csv, i.e. journals flagged up as having pubpeer comments. We can if need be cross reference those.  

In addition, I selected 3 journals at random from the mail list, Hjournals.csv, which has all the journals listed on the website. This is to check for problems in journals not already on our radar.

83: Clinical Reports in Veterinary Medicine Has only one page! 15 papers. Most look kosher emails
216 : J Thyroid research - Has only one page!  9 papers, only 2 with academic affiliations
220: J Tropical medicine  - has only 7 pages - lots of gmail addresses

So this is interesting - it seems we also have a species of journal that publishes only a handful of papers each year. Things like publication lags look normal for thse. 

I tried a few more
1: Abstract Applied Analysis  39 papers in 2022; generally look OK
113: Indoor Air  - this one seems to have been taken over from another publisher - nil on website
166: Journal of Aging Research - only 10 papers; dates /emails look fine


## First task
Would be useful to know about retractions and corrections
Go through titles and find "Retracted:", and then find the original article - should have same title minus the retracted. 
Create a df column that gives the row ID of the match, and another specifying if correction/retraction




```{r findretracted}

thisjournal<-'cin_220p'
thisjournal<-'cmmm_113p'
thisjournal<-'ecam_139p'
thisjournal<-'jeph_46p'
thisjournal<-'jhe_76p'
thisjournal<-'misy_122p'
thisjournal<-'wcmc_170p'
thisjournal<-'js_58p'
thisjournal<-'cin_220p'
thisjournal<-'scn_94p'
thisjournal<-'mpe_200p'
thisjournal<-'dm_56p'
thisjournal<-'sp_72p'
jfile<-paste0('H_articles_',thisjournal,'.csv')
thisfile<-here('Hindawi_results',jfile)
mydf<- read.csv(thisfile)
w<-which(colnames(mydf)=='retracted')

if(length(w)==0){ #if retracted col not present, create it now
  

mydf$retracted<-NA
mydf$corrected<-NA
matches<-unlist(gregexpr('Retracted:', mydf$title))
w<-which(matches> -1) #row number of those with 'Retracted:'
mydf$retracted[w]<- 0 #flag retraction with 0 (identifies retraction even if not matched)
#Can we match it with an earlier paper? (may not, if it was in previous year)
if(length(w)>0){
for (r in 1:length(w)){
  
trunctitle<-substring(mydf$title[w[r]],12,nchar(mydf$title[w[r]])) #title without "Retraction:"
ww<-which(mydf$title==trunctitle)
if(length(ww)>0){
  mydf$retracted[ww]<-w[r]
  mydf$retracted[w[r]]<-(-ww)
}
}
}
}
#There are also some marked "Corrigendum to" which I have not coded but could
```


# Publication lag  

Compute N days from receipt to a) revision and b) acceptance.

Some don't have revision marked, in which case could set date as same as acceptance - i.e. this would then be initial response.

I'll make it 3 columns to avoid too much confusion.  
Need to remember how to calculate dates.  

```{r computelags}
#NB if re-reading a file that is already processed, this won't work!
w<-which(colnames(df)=='days_rec_acc') #check if conversion for dates done
if(length(w)==0){
#convert to R date format
#NB if it was opened in xls then format may have changed! Need to check
datecol<-which(colnames(mydf)=='received')
#Need to test date format as it varies by journal.
testdate<-mydf[1,datecol]
dateformat<-'%d-%b-%y'
if(length(testdate)==1)
{dateformat<-'%d %b %Y'} #for now we assume date format is either %d-%b-%y or %d %b %Y : in which case we can detect which one by the length.
for (d in datecol:(datecol+3)){
  mydf[,d]<-as.Date(mydf[,d],dateformat)
}

mydf$days_rec_rev<-as.numeric(mydf$revised-mydf$received)
mydf$days_rec_acc<-as.numeric(mydf$accepted-mydf$received)

mydf$daysresp<-mydf$days_rec_acc
w<-which(!is.na(mydf$days_rec_rev))
mydf$daysresp[w]<-mydf$days_rec_rev[w]
w1<-which(mydf$days_rec_acc<0) #cases where accepted date not recorded


#As we have a copy of the files in the Scrape_Pub project, it seems safe to resave here with the updated information and the same name

#write.csv(mydf,thisfile,row.names=F) #save file updated with retraction and date info
}
```

Next options: identify most busy editors (those with most papers) and look at distributions of their lags, depending on whether or not special issue.

Are there some editors who do both special issue and non?

Initial check

```{r editorcheck}

#All editors
myed<-data.frame(table(mydf$editor))
#Remove those who handled fewer than 5 papers

myed<-myed[myed$Freq>4,]
myed<-myed[order(-myed$Freq),]
colnames(myed)<-c("Editor","Npapers")
myed$Editor<-unfactor(myed$Editor)

#Editors in special issues
myedsi<-data.frame(table(mydf$editor[mydf$SI!=0]))
myedsi<-myedsi[myedsi$Freq>4,]
myedsi<-myedsi[order(-myedsi$Freq),]
colnames(myedsi)<-c("Editor","Npapers")
myedsi$Editor<-unfactor(myedsi$Editor)

#Need to unfactor, otherwise different factors mess things up for the 2 dfs


myed$Nsi<-0
for (e in 1:nrow(myed)){
  w<-which(myedsi$Editor==myed$Editor[e])
  if(length(w)>0){
    myed$Nsi[e]<-myedsi$Npaper[w]
  }
}

myed$medianlag<-NA
myed$pbelow20<-NA

for (e in 1:nrow(myed)){
  w<-which(mydf$editor==myed$Editor[e])
  myed$medianlag[e]<-median(mydf$daysresp[w],na.rm=T)
  myed$pbelow20[e]<-100*length(which(mydf$daysresp[w]<20))/length(w)
  
}

myed<-myed[order(-myed$pbelow20),]


#Are any editors responsible for more than one special issue?

myed$SI<-NA
for (e in 1:nrow(myed)){
   w<-which(mydf$editor==myed$Editor[e])
   si<-unique(mydf$SI[w])
   if(length(si)>2){print(myed$Editor[e])}
   
  #print (si)
  myed$SI[e]<-si
}
#Confirm, some eds have more than one SI - but for some it is coded 0, ie they do some regular editing

filename<-paste0('Editors_',thisjournal,'.csv')
write.csv(myed,here('Editor_analysed',filename),row.names=F)




```
